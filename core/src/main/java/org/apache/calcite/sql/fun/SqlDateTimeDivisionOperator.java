/**
 * https://olapio.atlassian.net/browse/KE-12894
 *
 * A special operator for the division of timestamp diff function.
 * The purpose of defining a special operator is that
 * kylin could be able to distinguish normal division and timestamp diff division,
 * so kylin can cast, for example, (/INT(Reinterpret(-($23, $22)), 1000) to bigint,
 * otherwise, spark will be interpreting this expression as double type
